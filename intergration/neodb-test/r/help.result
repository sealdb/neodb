Name: 'INSERT'
Description:
Syntax:
INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED | HIGH_PRIORITY] [IGNORE]
    [INTO] tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [(col_name [, col_name] ...)]
    {VALUES | VALUE} (value_list) [, (value_list)] ...
    [ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE assignment_list]

INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | DELAYED | HIGH_PRIORITY] [IGNORE]
    [INTO] tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    SET assignment_list
    [ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE assignment_list]

INSERT [LOW_PRIORITY | HIGH_PRIORITY] [IGNORE]
    [INTO] tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [(col_name [, col_name] ...)]
    SELECT ...
    [ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE assignment_list]

value:
    {expr | DEFAULT}

value_list:
    value [, value] ...

assignment:
    col_name = value

assignment_list:
    assignment [, assignment] ...

INSERT inserts new rows into an existing table. The INSERT ... VALUES
and INSERT ... SET forms of the statement insert rows based on
explicitly specified values. The INSERT ... SELECT form inserts rows
selected from another table or tables. INSERT with an ON DUPLICATE KEY
UPDATE clause enables existing rows to be updated if a row to be
inserted would cause a duplicate value in a UNIQUE index or PRIMARY
KEY.

For additional information about INSERT ... SELECT and INSERT ... ON
DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, see [HELP INSERT SELECT], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-on-duplicate.html.

In MySQL 5.7, the DELAYED keyword is accepted but ignored by the
server. For the reasons for this, see [HELP INSERT DELAYED],

Inserting into a table requires the INSERT privilege for the table. If
the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause is used and a duplicate key causes
an UPDATE to be performed instead, the statement requires the UPDATE
privilege for the columns to be updated. For columns that are read but
not modified you need only the SELECT privilege (such as for a column
referenced only on the right hand side of an col_name=expr assignment
in an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause).

When inserting into a partitioned table, you can control which
partitions and subpartitions accept new rows. The PARTITION option
takes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more partitions or
subpartitions (or both) of the table. If any of the rows to be inserted
by a given INSERT statement do not match one of the partitions listed,
the INSERT statement fails with the error Found a row not matching the
given partition set. For more information and examples, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html.
